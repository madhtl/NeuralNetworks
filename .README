# Neural Network from Scratch, hebbian weight matrices, sigmoid f
Solution of backpropagation algorithm from scratch, using only numpy, the only additional libraries are:
sklearn.datasets -> access to a simple (iris) dataset
matplotlib..pyplot -> for visualisation purposes

Valuable info available in the notebook.
